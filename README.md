## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, React Router

**Server:** Node, Express, JWT

## Features

- Generate JWT grant access token
- Fetch envelopes from docusign admin account
- Fetch documents using docusign admin account

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`DOCUSIGN_CLIENT_ID`

`DOCUSIGN_USER_ID`

`DOCUSIGN_ACCOUNT_ID`


## Setting up Docusign Account and env variables

### Step 1 - Creating docusign account

Head over to https://developers.docusign.com/ and create a free developer account.

### Step 2 - Generating some envelopes

On the top of your docusign developer account, click on agreements > Start (left sidebar) > Envelopes > Send an envelope.

Upload your files, enter recipients and click on send.

Specify the placeholders to be filled by recipients and send.

Ask the recipients to sign the envelope and complete the envelope workflow.

Click on generate an RSA pair. Store the public key in a public.pem file and the private key in a private.pem file. You will need these files later on in the root of your server application.

Add a redirect uri - http://localhost

Add origin url - http://localhost:5000

Enable GET and POST http methods

Save the app.

### Step 4 - Storing env keys

Copy the integration key and paste it in env `DOCUSIGN_CLIENT_ID`

Copy the account id and paste it in env `DOCUSIGN_ACCOUNT_ID`

## FAQ

#### DocuSignâ€™s integration capabilities

 Docusign provides 2 ways to be integrated in an app: SDK and APIs.
 
 For SDK, please check their docs: https://developers.docusign.com/docs/sdks/
 
 In this tutorial, we will explore APIs of docusign. We will be fetching envelopes and their documents from a docusign admin account.

#### Whether DocuSign files can be accessed externally

Yes, they can be accessed by the owner of the document and the invited members. In this tutorial, we access the documents via API and a JWT grant token.

#### API documentation and its functionality

 Docusign API docs: https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/

#### Any potential risks or limitations with the integration

For our tutorial, you need to securely store the private key, client id, account id, user id on the backend servers. From, frontend pov there is no risk, since no docusign api is being directly called there.

#### Can this document be viewed by multiple users of the XYZ? Given, each user has different account credentials for XYZ app, they do not have any information regarding the docusign.

Yes, this is possible via admin account.
